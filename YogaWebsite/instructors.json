    "info": "Hi all, I am Kacy Steiger. In 2021 I completed my Yoga Alliance certified 200-hr YTT in Hatha yoga with strong Kripalu influence from the SamsaraSukha School of Yoga under the tutelage of Kelly Carver. I believe that everyone can benefit from yoga, both on and off the mat, and strive to provide a non-judgmental, fun place for people to practice. I found my niche in teaching slower paced, alignment-orientated classes with students focusing on what they can do, not what they canâ€™t. When not working or teaching, I love spending time with my family and my dog, reading (giant book nerd), traveling, writing my novel and buying too many plants and crystals. I have my B.A. in English and Writing from UNC Charlotte and currently work as a library service specialist. I call the Denver area my home.",
